# README

JS Vulnerabilities Detector is a Visual Studio Code extension which detects security vulnerabilities in JavaScript / Typescript code. As you open a JS or TS file and start writing code, it scans the file and highlights suspicious and potentially vulnerable code. Detected vulnerabilities are also listed in the ''Problems' tab. Quick fixes are offered to relevant issues.

## Features

These potential vulnerabilities are detected:
- 'eval(...)' functions
- HTML rendering methods:
    1. document.write('...');
    2. document.writeln('...');
    3. element.innerHTML = '...';
    4. element.outerHTML = '...';
- '<script>...</script>' code blocks
- TODO notes

Quick fixes offered to relevant issues:
- document.write('...') -> document.write(escape('...'))
- document.writeln('...') -> document.writeln(escape('...'))
- element.innerHTML = '...' -> element.innerText = '...' or element.textContent = '...'
